***Horus***
* <i><u>1/25 - Current </u></i> <br />
Pluggable framework that queries and puts "the internet" into a gigantic DB which can then be queried as new "template vulnerabilities" are found. Currently locates dangling DNS domains and publicly facing Docker Registries. Recieved Bug Bounties on 2 Alexa top1000 domains and have reported bounties to over 15 large corporations.

***[KLEENEX](https://github.com/svv232/Kleenex)*** 
* <i><u>7/18 - 8/18</u></i> <br />
C++ wrapper around KLEE and AFL for intelligent, coverage guided fuzzing. Developed while doing research at MWR Infosecurity. Path analysis was used to generate test cases, and mutation based fuzzing techniques were applied to these initial test cases.

***[1nsanity](https://github.com/svv232/1nsanity)***
* <i><u>4/18- 8/18</u></i> <br />
1nsanity is a LLVM pass that obfuscates against symbolic execution. It includes mathematical obfuscation, bogus control flow injection, and tacks on additional complexity to switch cases and branch instructions. It uses the Collatz Conjecture as an opaque predicate. 

***PiBrain Assistant***
* <i><u>11/17 - Current</u></i> <br />
Modeling an encoder and decoder neural network to simulate language understanding in a virtual assistant; written with tensorflow and powered by GPUs and AWS.
